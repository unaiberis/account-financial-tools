This module extends the functionality of ``account_chart_update`` so
that if taxes or fiscal position templates have translated fields, they
are passed to the final taxes or fiscal positions when applying the
chart of accounts.

.. IMPORTANT::
   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.
   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.

Configuration
=============

It is not necessary to apply any previous configuration to use this
module, but you may want to load some translation to taxes or fiscal
positions beforehand.

You can do this by installing account_usability to be able to view the
templates and edit their translations. Or you can include translations
in a custom module inside the i18n_extra folder.

Usage
=====

To use this module simply follow the steps in the USAGE section of the
``account_chart_update`` module.
